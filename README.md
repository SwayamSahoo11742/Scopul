`Scopul` is a python package to extract data from MIDI files!

Scopul can also do additional functionality such as generating PDFs or tempo conversions.


## Installation
```cmd
$ pip install scopul
```

## Simple Example

```python
from Scopul import Scopul, config_musescore

scop = Scopul("test.mid")

# Sample output
>>> "3/4"

```
