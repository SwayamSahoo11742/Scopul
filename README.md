`Scopul` is a python package to extract data from MIDI files!

![scopul-rep](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117121187/219198671-72a73a16-b168-4b4c-abe5-e384c9624e3c.gif)

Scopul can also do additional functionality such as generating PDFs or tempo conversions.


## Installation
```cmd
$ pip install scopul
```

## Simple Example

```python
from Scopul import Scopul, config_musescore

scop = Scopul("test.mid")


# Get tempo
print(scop.tempo.ratio)


# Sample output
>>> "3/4"

```
## Future Plans
### Things to look forward in the next release, any suggestions will be appreciated
- Time signature conversions
- Tempo conversions
- Extract a specific rhythm
- Altering MIDI (adding/Deleting measures or notes)

### Things for the distant future, any suggestions will be appreciated
- Chord extraction: Allow the extraction of chord progressions from the MIDI file.
- Key detection: Implement a function to detect the key of the MIDI file.
- Melody extraction: Allow the extraction of the melody from the MIDI file.
- Harmonic analysis: Provide harmonic analysis of the MIDI file by identifying chords and their progressions.
- Drum track extraction: Allow the extraction of the drum track from the MIDI file.
- Time signature detection: Implement a function to detect the time signature of the MIDI file.
- Quantization: Implement a function to quantize the notes in the MIDI file to a particular grid size.
- Instrument recognition: Provide functionality to recognize the instruments used in the MIDI file.
- MIDI file validation: Implement a function to validate the structure of the MIDI file and detect any errors.
- Export to other formats: Allow the export of the MIDI data to other formats such as CSV, JSON, or XML.
