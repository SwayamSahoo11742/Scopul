`Scopul` is a python package to extract data from MIDI files!

![scopul-rep](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117121187/219198671-72a73a16-b168-4b4c-abe5-e384c9624e3c.gif)

Scopul can also do additional functionality such as generating PDFs or tempo conversions.


## Installation
```cmd
$ pip install scopul
```

## Simple Example

```python
from Scopul import Scopul, config_musescore

scop = Scopul("test.mid")


# Get tempo
print(scop.get_audio_lenght())


# Sample output
>>> "12.467519999999997"

```
## Future Plans
ðŸŸ¡ = In progress

ðŸŸ  = To-Do

ðŸŸ¢ = Done

### Things to look forward in the next major release, any suggestions will be appreciated
- Deletion of elements (Only addition is currently supported)ðŸŸ 
- Create and add parts, consisting of multiple other Scopul Musical ElementsðŸŸ 
- Chord extraction: Allow the extraction of chord progressions from the MIDI file.ðŸŸ 
- Key detection: Implement a function to detect the key of the MIDI file.ðŸŸ 
- Melody extraction: Allow the extraction of the melody from the MIDI file.ðŸŸ 
- Harmonic analysis: Provide harmonic analysis of the MIDI file by identifying chords and their progressions.ðŸŸ 

### Things for the distant future, any suggestions will be appreciated
- Drum track extraction: Allow the extraction of the drum track from the MIDI file.ðŸŸ 
- Quantization: Implement a function to quantize the notes in the MIDI file to a particular grid size.ðŸŸ 
- MIDI file validation: Implement a function to validate the structure of the MIDI file and detect any errors.ðŸŸ 
- Export to other formats: Allow the export of the MIDI data to other formats such as CSV, JSON, or XML.ðŸŸ 
- 
None of this is happening anytime soon. 
## Bugs
- A lot of the MIDI to PDF conversions are still throwing errors
- PDFs and XMLs are not generating with title
